                        <p>Evil Hangman was the first major game that I created when 
                            I learned how to program. Instead of a typical game of 
                            hangman, the computer never chooses a word and removes all 
                            words that contain the letter you picked until there are no 
                            more options. Once there are no more options, the computer 
                            will give you a letter and will repeat the process again.</p>

                    <p>I have experience creating websites, mobile applications,
