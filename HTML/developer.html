                        <h2>Evil Hangman</h2>
                        <p>Evil Hangman was the first major game that I created when I learned how to program. Instead of a typical game of hangman, the computer never choses a word and removes all words that contain the letter you picked until thier are no more options. Once thier are no more options, the compter will give you a letter and will reapeat the process again.</p>
